The latest releases must have been announced in
flex [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/westes/flex/releases/).

Compare the latest upstream release with the latest xPack
[release](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/flex-xpack/releases).
If necessary, update the triplet, otherwise increase the fourth number,
